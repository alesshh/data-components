> Simple structure to manage components for non SPA projects

## Install

```sh
$ npm install data-components --save
```

## Motivation

There are plenty of options to architect a web application but often they're complex or assume you're working on a SPA.
I just wanted a simple and flexible structure for non SPA projects, so I built this.

## Usage

### Bootstrap

One of the greatest advantages behind following a component structure is that you have zero context awareness. Having to manually bootstrap modules on different pages of a project is error-prone, not productive and can often cause trouble (e.g: renaming a component then having to change all the references to it all across the project).

On your application entry point, simply call the component bootstrap function. Here we're saving a reference on the global scope so we can later reference it:

```js
import components from 'data-components';

// Create a `UI` namespace
window.UI = components();
```

### Component structure

It uses data attributes to identify components and their options. Here's an example:

```html
<ul data-component="list" data-toggle="click">
  <li>Do the laundry</li>
  <li>Finish homework</li>
  <li>Buy spaghetti and tomato sauce</li>
</ul>
```

Notice that you specify a component name via `data-component`. This way it'll know this component must be mounted.

Now you need an implementation for your component:

```js
class List {
  constructor() {
    // ...
  }

  // Automatically called
  initialize(node, options) {
    console.log(`Bootstrapping list that toggle its visibility on "${options.toggle}" event`);
  }
};
```

It's that simple. On the `initialize()` method you'll receive a reference for the component markup and its options (`data-*`).

### Accessing components

Every time a component is mounted, it'll save the instance to its own sandbox. In our case this sandbox is the value of `window.UI`.

It's really just a plain object but it comes with a handy `get()` method for accessing registered components:

```js
UI.get('list'); //=> List {}
```

### Custom exports

Often you use the same component multiple times under the same context and that's when custom exports come in handy. Simple specify `data-exports` and it will use it to store the component instance into its unique reference.

Using our previous example, imagine that we have two different lists but both share the same component implementation:

```html
<ul data-component="list" data-exports="home">
  <li>Do the laundry</li>
  <li>Buy spaghetti and tomato sauce</li>
</ul>

<ul data-component="list" data-exports="school">
  <li>Finish homework</li>
</ul>
```

Now you have a unique identifier for both components:

```js
// Tasks under "home" list
UI.get('home'); //=> List {}

// Tasks under "school" list
UI.get('school'); //=> List {}
```

### Final thoughts

This is obviously no wildcard and really there are better options out there if you're working on a SPA, but it sure helps to keep an organized codebase.

I started playing with this idea [a while ago](https://gist.github.com/rafaelrinaldi/cf0c3851070cd935ef55) and I'm already successfully using it in two production projects (with more than two developers besides myself).
