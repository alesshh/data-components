## What does "unstable" mean?

An unstable branch may have larger, potentially breaking changes that will occur during iteration towards the next even numbered (stable) release. It will contain all of the latest code and bug fixes, but will have higher volatility and churn than the stable branch while we work out all of the bugs in new release.
